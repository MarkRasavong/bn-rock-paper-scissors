## Overview

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game that has been played for generations. It is a simple game that requires no equipment and can be played by people of all ages. The rules of the game are easy to learn: two players make a fist with their hand and then simultaneously reveal one of three hand gestures, either rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), or scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended). Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The game is typically used as a method of making decisions or settling disputes in a friendly and non-violent manner. <br>

Rock, Paper, Scissors has been popularized globally, with variations and alternative names used in different cultures. Despite its simplicity, the game has been studied scientifically and has been used in research on human decision-making.
